## Project Proposal

Our project will be an interactive adventure-esc game. The user will be a "player" who can visit bars, talk to bartenders, and enjoy refreshments and snacks. If the player gets bored of the variety in his vicinity, he can use the Airport or MagicTree to travel to different cities and/or realms to try the consumables there. On the other hand, the bartenders(us), can create locations and consumables for the user to try.
